# Task2
Create a smart contract that swaps USDC to USDT and lends the received USDT on Compound Finance in one transaction. You also have to create a hardhat script which performs the above action.

Approch I used to solve this task (Not able to complete)

Steps:
    1: I read the problem and divide that into 2 sub-tasks one is swaping and another is Lending on Compound Finance  
    2: For swaping I understand uniswap and from there guide I try to used Uniswap single-swaps (But not able to swap)
    3: And for lending on Compound Finance I Research on Compound and studied about that 
    4: What I understand and planed for accompllish this task is 
        4.1: ERC20 and CErc20 Interface need to used.
        4.2: Then I need to approve the CERC token contract 
        4.3: Then For lending I need to call mint function of CERC token.
    So, the above steps I planned to achieve the second task but unfortunately not able to do so.
